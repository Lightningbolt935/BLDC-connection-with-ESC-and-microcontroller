# BLDC-connection-with-ESC-and-microcontroller
Simulation for the connection of BLDC to electronic speed controller which we can make as a combination of universal bridge and pwm generator to microcontroller like esp32 or arduino uno and finally a battery of about 24V or 48V for our Hyperloop model
